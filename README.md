Python for DevOps: 8-Week Learning Roadmap
If you want to understand the importance of python for DevOps, please read the detailed python for DevOps guide.

📌 Overview
This roadmap is designed to help DevOps Engineers and Platform Engineers master Python for automation, cloud operations, infrastructure as code, and Kubernetes. The curriculum includes hands-on projects that mimic real-world DevOps tasks using industry tools like Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

By the end of this roadmap, you'll:

Automate repetitive tasks with Python
Work with cloud APIs and infrastructure automation
Build Python-based DevOps tools and microservices
Deploy containerized apps with Docker and Kubernetes
Use AI-powered tools like LlamaIndex & GenAI for DevOps
Be fully prepared for Python-based DevOps interviews
